firstAggr gets this as argument:
* RPS is a game ,
* A participates in RPS ,
* A plays ,
* A throws rock ,
* C plays ,
* C participates in RPS ,
* C throws scissors and
* rock beats scissors

groupBy' samePred statements returns this:

[[RPS is a game] ,
[A participates in RPS , C participates in RPS] ,
[A plays               , C plays ],
[A throws rock] ,
[C throws scissors],
[rock beats scissors]]

aggregateSubj transforms that list of lists into

* RPS is a game ,
* A and C participate in RPS ,
* A and C play ,
* A throws rock ,
* C throws scissors and
* rock beats scissors

groupBy sameSubj returns this:

[
[ RPS is a game ],
[ A and C participate in RPS , A and C play ],
[ A throws rock ],
[ C throws scissors],
[ rock beats scissors]]

aggregatePred transforms that list of lists into

* RPS is a game ,
* A and C play and participate in RPS ,
* A throws rock ,
* C throws scissors and
* rock beats scissors
