# l4 encoding of Rule 34

# TODO Figure out how to approach the LPDAT defeasibility in this syntax.

# Thoughts on Syntax:
# 1. The way predicates are used in the rules is visually unrelated to both of the
#    methods of declaring them. That creates cognitive load.
# 2. Conjunction happens all the time, it should be implicit with newlines.
# 3. "OR" is clearer than "||", and the same length.
# 4. We should use indentation instead of brackets.
# 5. There should be a way to say in the class definition that
#    certain predicates are true, or have known values, for certain classes.
#    For example, if LegalPractitioner extends Person, then we should
#    be able to say that by default, for LegalPractitioner, AuthorizedToPracticeLaw
#    is true.
# 6. Using a period to separate the variables and the contents of the quantifiers
#    is really unintuitive. Again, indentation would be better.
# 7. Declarating the variables for conditions and quantifications is redundant if the
#    predicates have been defined with types. You know from DescribedInSection1 b,
#    that b is a business, because the type of DescribedInSection1 is Business -> Boolean.
#    Something else could be done to distinguish variables from atoms, I think.
# 8. I think existential quantification should be implicit if the user doesn't specify.
# 9. It not clear whether adding -> Boolean to the end of a class attribute declaration does anything.
# 10. It's not clear whether nesting exists statements is mandatory or optional, or what it means semantically.
# 11. It seems inconsistent whether I'm supposed to us a unary predicate Trade o or the `:` notation.
# 12. Are you required to use a type declaration when defining variables for an exists or forall statement? Why?
#     I'm worried that might force people to fiddle with their object hierarchies, or that it might require
#     making it possible to extend from multiple classes, or adopt interfaces, or whatever.
# 13. I worry that using the word "class" and "extends" will cause incorrect presumptions about the semantics
#     of those declarations.
# 14. I don't have any way to specify boolean propositions that don't have a type. I have to use a Global type and use
#     the `:` notation.
# 15. I don't have equality and inequality operators?
# 16. Things like "Beneficial Owner" are legal terms of art that are not likely to be accurately translated across langauges.
# 17. The lexicon very quickly gets very long. Needing to re-type all the names is tedious and error prone. The wordnet
#     references should be integrated with the class defintions.
# 18. The lower a level of detail you choose to model, the easier it is to write the rules, and the harder it is to write
#     the lexicon.
# 19. It would be useful if we could also replace the default translation that GF provides on a case-by-case basis, using
#     something like s(CASP)'s predicate statements, as a stop-gap measure.
# 20. The method of defeasibility I'm using below is painful, and inadequate.
#     Half the code implements defeasibility, when it could be done in a matter of
#     a dozen lines, or so.
